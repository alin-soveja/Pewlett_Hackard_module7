# Pewlett_Hackard_module7
Pewlett Hackard is facing an upcoming "silver tsunami". A very large number of employees will be reaching retirment age at the same time creating a mass exodus of talent.

**Objectives**

We have been tasked with compiling and analyzing 6 different spreadsheets maintained by the company to determine:


1. Total number and details of employees reaching retirement age
2. Total number and details by Dept retiring
3. Total number and details by job title retiring
4. List of possible employees to target mentorship eligibility
