# Pewlett_Hackard_module7
Pewlett Hackard is facing an upcoming "silver tsunami". A very large number of employees will be reaching retirment age at the same time creating a mass exodus of talent.

**Objectives**

We have been tasked with compiling and analyzing 6 different spreadsheets maintained by the company to determine:


1. Total number and details of employees reaching retirement age
2. Total number and details by Dept retiring
3. Total number and details by job title retiring
4. List of possible employees to target mentorship eligibility


**Results**

Employee retiring by title
72458 current employees will be retiring
These are distributed over 7 different positions


**Mentorship Program**

1549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program
6 different positions have employees eligible for mentorship program


**Summary**

The overall impact is 72,458 current employees will be retiring. The biggest impact is to senior engineers (25,916) and senior staff (24,926).

There are a very limited number of mentorship eligible emploees in comparison to the numbers vacating each position.

    **Recommendations**
    
1. It is recommended that a career development plan be put in place to cultivate those in the junior roles to be able to move into the senior roles. This will set them up to develop new hires as they come into the entry positions, thus maintaining a perpetual cycle of mentorship and readiness.
2. It is further recommended to implement the immediate mentorship plan by recruiting retirees to continue to work part time as consultants to develop and launch the mentorship program.
